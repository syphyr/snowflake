snowflake-client for Debian
=====================

Using a snowflake bridge
---------------------

To use a snowflake bridge, please add the following lines to
`/etc/tor/torrc`:

    ClientTransportPlugin snowflake exec /usr/bin/snowflake-client
    UseBridges 1

Then for each bridges, add a line looking like the following one:

    Bridge snowflake 192.0.2.3:1 2B280B2...

Actual Bridge lines are usually given by Tor Project's bridge database
or by the bridge operator directly.
